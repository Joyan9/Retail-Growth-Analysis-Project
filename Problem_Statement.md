# Retail Growth Analysis

## Your Mission

eBay’s Q4 performance shattered volume records, but topline growth is masking a mixed profitability narrative. While Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) surged, net margins in key regions showed alarming volatility. The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) needs clarity, not just data.

Your mission is to:

- Conduct a forensic profitability audit of Q4 retail transactions.  
- Isolate **"empty calorie" growth**—identifying categories with high volume but low margin.  
- Pinpoint regional drags on Return on Investment (ROI).  
- Formulate a data-backed pivot strategy for the Fiscal Year 2024 operating plan.
